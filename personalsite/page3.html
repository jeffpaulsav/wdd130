        There are a lot of ways to define correct form. As long as your prefered method adheres to the rules of the lift 
        to make the attempt valid, than the execution does not matter as much. The rules to be followed include, obeying 
        "bench", "press", and "rack" commands from the head judge, and having 2 points of contact on the bench, 2 points being 
        your glutes and upper back, at all times. The repetition itself is considered paused which makes it difficult unless 
        trained specifically.

    <p>
        The distance that the weights travel does not have any consideration on whether a repetition counts within competition, 
        that is why there is a disconnect on powerlifting form and typical traning form. There are instances where during 
        competition the weight travels within 2 inches and is considered a full rep by judges.
