        In a powerlifting competition, athletes compete in three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. Each lifter is 
        allowed three attempts at each lift, and the heaviest successful attempt in each lift is combined for a total score. 
        Competitors are usually divided into weight classes, and there are also age and skill divisions. During the competition, 
        lifters are given a specific amount of time to complete their lifts, and they must adhere to strict rules regarding technique 
        and execution. Judges closely observe each lift to ensure that it meets the established standards, such as reaching proper 
        depth in the squat, maintaining a stable position in the bench press, and locking out the deadlift. The lifter with the 
        highest total weight lifted in their respective category is declared the winner. Powerlifting competitions often feature an 
        electrifying atmosphere, with athletes and spectators cheering and encouraging each other throughout the event.
